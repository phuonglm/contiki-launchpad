Short explanation of SimpleRDC:
  All nodes with SimpleRDC have their radio off and wake up periodically, turning
  the radio on and listen for traffic for a short period of time. To transmit to
  a destination node, we repeatedly transmit the same packet in full until one
  of two things happen:
    1) a full period is covered
    2) for unicasts, we receive an ACK from the destination, meaning it is
       received and the sender do not have to send any more, thus it can go back
       to sleep early
  The transmissions are timed to the wake-up interval and stay-awake-time so
  that at least two transmissions are performed during a node wake-up. If it
  wakes up and hears traffic, yet do not receive a complete packet within a set
  period, it goes down to sleep again.

  ACKs are sent either by the radio hardware automatically, in the radio driver,
  or from SimpleRDC. The speed (and hence efficiency) of which this happens is,
  from faster to slower, following the same order.

  SimpleRDC is designed to be lean and simple and stems originally from several
  other radio duty cycling protocols: nullrdc, ContikiMAC, Thingsquare Drowsie,
  IEEE 802.15.4e CSL. To reduce size and complexity, lots of functionality was
  removed, such as support for uIP, neighbor tables to track wake-up phases and
  more.

  The radio is assumed to start in Rx mode, and return to Rx after recieving
  or sending data, hence the radio is explicitly turned off when needed to.
  Also, as we assume small packet buffers and simple radio hardware, there is
  no support for streaming data (ie infinite packet length), burst transmissions
  (staying awake to send many packets immediately after eachother).

  SimpleRDC is configured with a few settings, as below. The most basic ones are
    * how often to wake up (channel check rate)
    * how long to stay awake (on-time)
    * do SimpleRDC, the radio driver, or the radio hw send ACKs?
    * how long to wait for an ACK after sending
  The timings dependa on things like radio bitrate, packet sizes, transfer
  time mcu <-> radio etc. The default settings are optimized for a 250kbps, SPI-
  based radio such as the CC2420 or the CC2500 sending less than 64 byte packets.
  Note that some radios or radio drivers by default do filtering or automatic
  handling which may interfere. For CC2420, auto-ack must be turned off.

  Example power consumption:
    a simple setup of one node simply idle listening and one node sending a
    unicast every third second, the radio duty cycle is as follows.
    Conf
      #define NETSTACK_CONF_MAC     nullmac_driver
      #define NETSTACK_CONF_RDC     simplerdc_driver
      #define NETSTACK_CONF_FRAMER  framer_nullmac
    Without unicast ACKs (so the sender can finish early)
        sender      10.7 % (of which ca 1.4 % is in transmission)
        listener     5.9 %
    With unicast ACKs in SimpleRDC
      COOJA failed to produce statistics strangely enough, but on average the overhead
      for sending should be on average half the sending period, and listener little
      more, thus approximately this:
        sender       7.5 %
        listener     6.5 %
    With unicast ACKs in radio hardware
      this should be even less

    tBTx    AFTER_TX_HOLDOFF, the time it takes for a packet to be received and
                ACKed.

--------------------------
This is the time it takes to transmit X bytes (total, as seen by radio) at 250 kbaud

    len (B)      t (ms)
    ======       ======
      3           0.20      == length of an ACK
      10          0.42      time to copy to TXFIFO: 30 us
      20          0.74      time to copy to TXFIFO: 52 us
      30          1.06      time to copy to TXFIFO: 73 us
      40          1.38      time to copy to TXFIFO: 95 us
      50          1.70      time to copy to TXFIFO: 116 us
      60          2.02      time to copy to TXFIFO: 138 us

Ie, time to receive a packet, copy ACK->fifo, send ACK, would be < 0.30 ms, but
  do we need to wait for a process to be polled as well? Should be rather fast,
  not the 7.8 ms of a 128 Hz sys clock.

 * Enable unicast ACKs from SimpleRDC as opposed to the radio layer, or not at all.

 * if the radio doesn't ACK (either in hardware or at radio layer), then we can
 * ACK here so that a sender can stop sending early. If ACKs are transmitted at
 * neither place, the sender will keep on sending repeatedly for an entire
 * TX_PERIOD time, hence early unicast ACKs are primarily a way to save energy,
 * not (in the current implementation at least) for adding reliability as

 * This ACK will take longer time than at radio layer, so it's less efficient.
 *
 * Thus, set to 1 if radio layer/hardware does not ACK by itself.
 * Set to 0 if radio handles ACKs, or if you are unsure. It will work, but be
